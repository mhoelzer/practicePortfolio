# Eleven Fifty Starter Portfolio
This is a starter repo to help students get started on building a Bootstrap template. 

## Branches
This repo is broken into branches so that students can see a front end starter project get built over time. 
 
 * [master](https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/JavaScript-151-PortfolioStarter) - The most up to date version of the code.
 * [module-1-setup](https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/JavaScript-151-PortfolioStarter/tree/module-1-setup) - Just getting some things started in the project.
 * [module-2-gulp](https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/JavaScript-151-PortfolioStarter/tree/module-2-gulpsetup) - Set up Gulp for easy reload of html.
 * [module-3-bootstrap-and-jquery](https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/JavaScript-151-PortfolioStarter/tree/module-3-bootstrap-and-jquery) - Setting up basic jQuery and bootstrap. Testing with a nav bar.

## Current Branch Activity
1. We installed Bootstrap, jQuery, and font-awesome.
2. Added script tag for bootstrap.css in the head.
3. Added script tags for jQuery(must be first) & Bootstrap at the bottom of the body. 
4. Tested to make sure it's bootstrapped. 

## npm commands
If you build this from scratch without using the package.json file to load everything, you'll need to run these commands.
- `npm install bootstrap --save` Install Bootstrap into your Node Modules folder.
- `npm install jquery --save` Install jQuery into node modules.
- `npm install font-awesome --save` Install jQuery into node modules.

## Current Gulp Tasks
- `gulp serve` uses browserSync & opens a project in the browser. Reloads when you save.
